### Overview

As the projects complexity increase, simple coupled approaches get more complex by entanglement with a mix of architecture, generics, and patterns.

So to easily abstract architecture, generics, and patterns, here I'll have a bunch of these “simple approaches”, as straight into the point as possible.
